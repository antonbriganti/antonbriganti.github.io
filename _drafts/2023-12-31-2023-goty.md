title: Games I Played In 2023 That Released In 2023

It's a pretty overplayed statement but 2023's been a really good year for video games. There's been a lot of cool games released, to the point that a lot of games stopped being talked pretty quickly after release because something else brand new came out. In an effort to discuss and remember the games I've played this year beyond just their score/10, I've written some brief reviews to help provide some context to how I feel.

## WORLD OF HORROR (PC)

A fantastic game with a really cool presentation, fun short stories to play through and spooky art which is borderline plagiarism of Junji Ito‚Äôs work. The double sided blade of the rogue-like genre is ever present here - it‚Äôs got high replayability and it‚Äôs super fun to play with different builds but you can also be left wanting more after you‚Äôve played the same mystery for the tenth time in a row while trying to unlock something that has arcane conditions. **9/10**

## The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)

Is this just Breath of the Wild again but even more refined and with a lot of cooler mechanics on top of it? Yes. Did I care? Nope. God bless the item dupe glitches for making the game way less grindy üôèüèª **9/10**

## Street Fighter 6 (PC, PS5)

Street Fighter 6 inspired me to play a grappler for the first time, and also inspired me to learn how to do 360 and 720 motions. I will never forget the feeling of pulling off my first 720 in a real match. For that, it will always hold a special place in my heart. Coming off the weak launch of SF5, I‚Äôm so glad that SF6 feels as good as it does. So many characters feel strong, the systems feel really well balanced and designed, and this time it actually launched with a real story mode. It‚Äôs got some flaws, like the sloppy input interpreter and the fact that I don‚Äôt win every single game, but it‚Äôs still just so good. 

In other words, *I've been a failure, I've been a success etc.* **9.5/10**

## Baldur's Gate 3 (PC)

A tour de force of the RPG genre and a game I can see myself playing multiple times to just see how differently things can play out. I didn‚Äôt think two of my final thoughts on the game were going to be ‚ÄúWow this feels like a Bethesda game moment‚Äù (pejorative) and ‚ÄúMan I wish they did this thing like Bethesda does‚Äù. As much as I enjoyed Act 3, it definitely needs some more polishing, which Larian is doing, but I think some things go beyond a bit of rebalancing or a couple new lines here and there. Still, Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 is just such a cool game and it‚Äôs great to play D&D 5e combat with an actual concrete ruleset for once. **9.5/10**


And now, for my GOTY...

## Resident Evil 4 Remake (PC)

The first time I parried an attack, I thought this game is good. The first time I perfect parried an attack, I thought this game was great. The first time I perfect parried a projectile from across the map that I only heard get shot, I knew this game was perfect. One of the best feeling games I‚Äôve ever played, it absolutely blew away my expectations. I don‚Äôt think RE4 needed a remake, but I‚Äôm glad it got one since this was the result. I‚Äôve thought about it all year and I‚Äôll keep thinking about it for many years to come. **10/10**
