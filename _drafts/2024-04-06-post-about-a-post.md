It was bound to happen eventually: I've had huge writer's block lately. Since mid February, I've been stuck trying to write this one blog post and I just couldn't make any progress with it at all. I stubbornly tried to stick with it but I'm throwing in the towel and instead I thought I'd write about why I think I had so much trouble with it, how I tried to get through it and why I'm giving up on it (for now at least).


## So, what was the post about?
You'll never believe it, but the concept of the post was about why it's okay to stop and delete/destroy the work you've done. I came up with the title of the post first - It's Okay To Throw It Away. I knew it was a banger because it rhymes. I was thinking a lot about how growth comes from the journey and that defining success on the end result can be reductive. You can make something bad, but if you learned a lot making it then why should you care? Just throw away the bad, dummy. 


## What went wrong?
A lot of things I think, but let's break it down.

### The concept kept changing
It's Okay To Throw It Away was originally inspired by the software engineering adage that you shouldn't get attached to your code because you're going to end up deleting it. So I had that as the original hook. I talked about why that's the case and why it was an important lesson for me to learn. Then I was going to segue into other aspects of my life where I follow a similar belief. 



I couldn't settle on the concept, I was never happy with whatever I wrote, I only got down like one sentence every time I sat down to work on it.
