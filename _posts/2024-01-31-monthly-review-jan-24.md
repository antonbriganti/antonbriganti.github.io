Like a bolt from the blue, it’s time for The Monthly Review! Last year I enjoyed the process of writing little reviews for all the games I played that I thought I’d try to do something like that more often through out the year. Each month I’ll be doing a review of a new album I’ve listened to, a new game I’ve played, and a new movie I’ve watched. And I have to keep this up because I spent a lot of time making a template for the thumbnail/article header, and I can’t let that all go to waste.

## Drake - For All The Dogs Scary Hours Edition 🎧

_**Release Year:** 2023, **Genre:** Hip Hop/Rap_


As every artist gets further into the career, it’s almost a guarantee that their fans are going to say “I like their older stuff better.” I don’t know if it’s always a fair statement - I think a lot of that sentiment tends to be tied more to the feelings of nostalgia someone might have for the earlier material than it is reflective of the quality of newer stuff. But sometimes it’s also just because the new shit ain’t as good, and I think that’s the case with Drake’s latest album. 

For All The Dogs is a bloated album where it feels like I’m listening to Drake say the same things he’s been saying since Views dropped. I don’t think I’d even call most of the album bad per se but it all kinda blends together in a not great way. It’s nearly 2 hours of Drake that feels like it could have been recorded from any time in the last 3-4 years. Like if you put this and Certified Lover Boy together, I think I’d have trouble trying to figure out which track is from which. It feels like a lot of the intentional structure behind his albums have gotten worse since More Life, which at least had the excuse of being a “playlist”. 

I get it, Drake’s trying to play to his audience by giving them what they want from a Drake album. You get exactly what you think you’ll get: some good rap verses, a couple of R&B crooners and an unsurprising amount of misogyny that makes you feel uncomfortable enough to skip those tracks the next time you listen. The main bulk of the album never really goes above “good” for the most part, but at least the Scary Hours tracks are all pretty great and give you just enough hope that maybe next time his album will be better. But I think I’ve come away from pretty much every post CLB album feeling the same way and I’m always left disappointed (except for Her Loss which was pretty good ngl).

## Chants of Sennaar 🎮

_**Release Year:** 2023, **Genre:** Puzzle, Adventure, **Platform:** PC_

Chants of Sennaar is the latest game in the very small subgenre I call “Obra Dinn-likes”. They’re puzzle games where you’ve got a limited context provided to you, and you’re thrown into the deep end where you have to use your deductive reasoning to solve something. In Return of the Obra Dinn, you have to figure out the identities and fates of all the passengers from an ill fated voyage by looking through recreations of the events that transpired. In Chants of Sennaar, you must learn to decipher and translate multiple languages based on the interactions and areas you find yourself in.

I think it’s quite a charming game, aided by its very colourful and stylised presentation. The gameplay loop of trying to figure out the meanings of each “word” is pretty engaging for the most part, like it’s very fun to interact with all the people and scenery, guessing at what they’re saying to you and learning things like the grammatical structure of the language. 

There’s some flaws - it can get pretty frustrating when you’ve only got a couple words left and you’re stuck running around the map trying to figure out what small interaction you’ve missed, and there’s some awkward short stealth and action sequences that show up which feel pretty out of place given the rest of the gameplay but the highs more than make up for those particular lows. The game’s got a great premise and even if the execution is uneven, there’s still not a lot like it out there so it’s worth checking out.

## The Iron Claw 🎬
![The Iron Claw](/public/images/2024-01/monthly-review/claw.jpeg){:width="500" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
_**Release Year:** 2023, **Genre:** Biopic, Drama_

The Iron Claw felt like watching the world’s slowest but most devastating car crash, and I mean that in a good way. I was familiar with the Von Erich family story going in so I was ready for all the tragedy that happens but it’s still just so sad to see Kevin Von Erich’s story play out. Even the halcyon days of the brothers being together and enjoying each other’s company was sad because I knew just how bad it was gonna get. It’s hard to believe that they had to cut things out to make it less sad.

Although it’s feels like a family drama more than anything, I think the movie did a great job with the brief glimpses of the wrestling world. It helps that 80s NWA wrestling had more of a realistic feel to it already, as opposed to the over the top vibe that the WWF had, so the matches didn’t feel too jarring in tone when they happened. Everyone clearly put in a lot of effort with the wrestling choreography which I can really appreciate given how difficult it must have been for the cast to learn to convincingly wrestler.

Speaking of the cast, pretty much everyone was so good in this. I think my personal favourite performance came from Zac Efron, who did just an absolutely stellar job. With such a strong cast, it’s hard to believe that the guy who played Ric Flair made it into the movie. Just an absolute stinker and it really took me out of the movie, it’s like the guy never saw a promo by Flair.
