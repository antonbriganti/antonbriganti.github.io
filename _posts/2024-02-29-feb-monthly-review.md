Like a bolt from the blue, it’s time for The Monthly Review! Despite it being the shortest month, I’m still writing a full length article! If that’s not dedication, I don’t know what is. I nearly didn't have a movie I wanted to talk about this time, which got me thinking about changing up the format for this. It's the same this time, but who knows, maybe I'll be writing about a TV show next time?

## 1999 WRITE THE FUTURE - hella (˃̣̣̥╭╮˂̣̣̥) ✧ ♡ ‧º·˚ 🎧

_**Release Year:** 2024, **Genre:** Hip Hop/Rap_

I used to be a super big fan of 88rising. When they first started blowing up in 2017ish, it really felt like there was this new wave coming. They had these cool new upcoming artists that had strong potential, and they had this really strong collective vibe. The original Head In The Clouds is emblematic of the era - multiple collabs between the label’s artists, the occasional feature from someone outside but still fit the vibe of the group, a couple of solo tracks here and there. The future looked bright to me for 88rising.

Since then, they’ve been a weird label. Undoubtedly they’ve gotten a lot more popular - their breakout star Joji went on a global stadium tour, their Head in the Clouds festival is now international, the label even got to curate the Shang Chi tie-in soundtrack! But now their identity feels hazy and they seem to be focusing more on signing/showcasing new artists instead of growing their originals. So I guess it’s poetic to some extent then that their latest project, 1999 WRITE THE FUTURE’s hella (˃̣̣̥╭╮˂̣̣̥) ✧ ♡ ‧º·˚ , feels just as representative of who they are now as the original Head in the Clouds did back in 2018. 

The album’s got a really cool cast of artists with some fun production going on throughout the little too long runtime. I never thought I’d hear Rick Ross and Rich Brian on the same song but hey now I have. There’s some kind of loose concept that’s here, with a couple of radio station DJ interludes that tie some tracks together but that also just feels like it disappears by the end of it. But there’s nothing more here. It’s just a very solid compilation album with a bunch of artists who don’t really feel like they belong together in a meaningful way. That’s not bad per se, it just feels like a missed opportunity. What I want from 88rising and what they’re doing are two different things, so while I mourn a lost future, at least I’ve got some fun tracks to listen to.

## Silent Hill: The Short Message 🎮

![Silent Hill: The Short Message](/public/images/2024-02/monthly-review/shortmessage.png)
_**Release Year:** 2024, **Genre:** Horror, **Platform:** PS5_

The Short Message is a very lacklustre and flawed experience and I don’t think I can really recommend it to anybody. It’s got some of the most generic modern horror gameplay, where you’re either walking through a linear level with the occasional basic puzzle or you’re getting chased by a monster you can’t hurt which immediately kills you if it catches you. It never plays with your expectations by suddenly turning an exploration area into a chase area, there’s always a very clear separation of spaces and the game prepares you that you’re about to go into a chase section.

What it lacks in gameplay, it also lacks in story and characters. You play as Anita, a teenage girl who’s trying to find her friend Maya in this big abandoned building. As the game progresses, you find out more about Anita’s relationships with her friends, her feelings of inadequacy brought on by social media, the trauma she’s experienced etc. There’s probably something that could be engaging but unfortunately the writing and voice acting is so stilted that it’s hard to get into it. All of the dialogue has that “teenager written by adults twice their age” feel to it, you know? 

There are some cool moments in the game, most of which I can’t go into with spoiling things, but they’re both few and not good enough to really make up for the shortcomings.  I’m not a big Silent Hill guy or anything, so I didn’t come away from it upset that it wasn’t good, but it is also sad to see what used to be an innovative series have yet another disappointing entry. At least it was free!

## Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves 🎬

![The Iron Claw](/public/images/2024-02/monthly-review/dungeons.jpeg){:width="500" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
_**Release Year:** 2023, **Genre:** Action, Adventure_

It’s a surprisingly great action adventure movie that really encapsulates the feeling of playing Dungeons and Dragons. You can almost see the rolls happen in real time, especially the failing ones like the Druid getting caught while pretending to be a guard or the Sorcerer crit failing an INT check and destroying the bridge in the Underdark. Hell, the movie itself is made like 10x better by being able to point at the screen and go “I know that!!” because you’ve played D&D (or Baldur’s Gate 3) before. Being able to see a spell and immediately know what it is, or hear the name of a city and thinking of time you spent there is great. 

So with such a strong reverence for the feel of D&D, the deviations from the rules of the game feel super glaring. As a Certified Bard Enjoyer, the biggest thing to me was the Bard was just a charismatic dude who’s good at thinking on his feet - he had no magical powers and he doesn’t even swing a sword or anything. The man doesn’t even sing songs in combat to inspire his friends! Just feels so weird to me. There’s other things where they didn’t commit to D&D mechanics harder. The druid only ever wildshapes, the barbarian never activates/goes into a rage. The paladin doesn’t even smite! 

I’ve talked a lot about the feel of the movie but not so much the story, which is exactly what you’d kinda expect for this type of movie. Standard hero’s journey affair. The witty writing and the cast’s chemistry really holds it all together, and I can imagine this being a lot less enjoyable without that being the case. It’s a big shame this didn’t do great on release, I imagine in a post-BG3 world it would actually do quite well.
