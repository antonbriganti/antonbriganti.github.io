title: 2023 Music In Review

For the last 7 years I’ve been keeping track of every album, EP, and mixtape I’ve listened to using spreadsheets. I got the idea from a friend I went to uni with (shout out Hoa) who did something similar for his manga and it’s become an ongoing ritual for me ever since. Usually it’s just for me and the most anyone else gets to see of it is when I do my yearly Insta post about album of the year. But now this year I thought I’d go through, get some interesting stats about what I’ve listened to etc. and share it with the world. 

##  Release of the Year rundown
Just so you don’t have to go to Instagram for the full context, here’s the winners of the most important categories!

*Wow look at that cool minimalist formatting, thanks iOS Notes app! You don't have to be used just for celebrity apologies*

Now that we've got an idea for what won, let's dive a little deeper into what won from each category:

### **AOTY:** Jeff Rosenstock - HELLMODE
![Jeff Rosenstock - HELLMODE](/public/images/2024-01/aoty/HELLMODE.jpg){:width="500" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
_**Favourite tracks**: 3 SUMMERS, HEAD, HEALMODE_

This is Jeff Rosenstock’s first time winning AOTY, although he was runner up in 2021 with his fantastic SKA DREAM. He lost to Kanye’s DONDA, which I do still enjoy, but I have to admit I go back to SKA DREAM a lot more so in retrospect maybe it was the wrong choice. HELLMODE is an album that took me a few listens to get into but I grew to really love it.  There’s a mix of high energy punk rock tracks which underscore lyrics about feeling hopeless in a burning world and some lighter cuts full of introspection. It’s weird that I can almost feel hopeful after listening to it despite some depressing topics but I think that’s the point. The planet is dying, the government hates us, the animals are leaving and the aliens aren't contacting us, but it doesn’t mean that it’s all bad. We just have to hope and try the best we can. 

### **EP/MOTY:**  NewJeans - 2nd EP 'Get Up'
![NewJeans - 2nd EP 'Get Up'](/public/images/2024-01/aoty/get-up.jpeg){:width="500" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
_**Favourite tracks**: Super Shy, ETA, Cool With You_

NewJeans’ sophomore EP 'Get Up' came in first for EP/Mixtape, marking the second time a K-Pop project has won the spot after Baekhyun’s Delight won in 2020. This is such a fun EP, pretty much every single track gets stuck in my head every time I play it. 12 minutes of just some of the best sounding K-Pop you’ve heard in your god damn life dude. It’s not a formal category but Super Shy is hands down my Song of the Year. It’s audio crack, I can’t get enough of it even after all this time. 

### Best non-2023 Releases 
Anything on this list would be an AOTY contender for the year it released in. I want to give a special shout out to two albums in particular.

![Alex Lahey - I Love You Like A Brother](/public/images/2024-01/aoty/alexlahey.jpg){:width="500" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
_**Favourite tracks**: Every Day’s the Weekend, I Haven’t Been Taking Care Of Myself_

**Alex Lahey’s I Love You Like A Brother** was the first album I listened to in 2023, so the fact that it had such a strong impact on me that I still thought about it by year’s end is really impressive. This actually happened last year as well, with The Weeknd’s Dawn FM.  It was my first time listening to Alex Lahey so I guess it’s apt that I started with her fantastic debut. 

![LCD Soundsystem - Sound Of Silver](/public/images/2024-01/aoty/soundofsilver.png){:width="500" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
_**Favourite tracks**: All My Friends, Us V Them, New York I Love You but You're Bringing Me Down_

The other album I want to mention is **LCD Soundsystem’s Sound Of Silver**. It became an instant favourite for me. It’s actually hard for me to describe why I like it so much, it just really clicked with me. It makes me want to dance, cry and dance while I cry. There’s just a lot here and it’s all so good. Listening to All My Friends for the first time and hearing that synth kick in right as James Murphy sings “You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan, and the next five years trying to be with your friends again”. It just hits so hard, I don’t know what to say man. There’s something so special there and I hope if you listen to it you feel the same way. Thank you Pedro for introducing this album to me. _**Favourite tracks**: All My Friends, Us V Them, New York I Love You but You're Bringing Me Down_

## Now it’s time for some stats
In my Insta wrap up, I dropped some numbers like total albums listened to, total new artists listened to etc. and compared them against last year’s numbers. So I figured for a long form version of that, we’d compare the numbers to every other year. Worth noting because of some formatting changes from when I started to track my music in 2017 to now, no data from that first year is represented in the graphs.

### Total listened to and Ratings
First up is a break down of how many things I've listened to and also an overview of all ratings I've given. I've split them into Albums and EPs/Mixtapes, because that's how I track things in my spreadsheet.

>If you don't know how I rate things (or if you just want a refresher), check out [my post about how I do scores and ratings!]({% link _posts/2023-11-10-scores-and-ratings.md %})

#### Albums

**

In 2023 I listened to 114 albums, which as you can see above is less than the previous year but still second overall, dethroning 2019. The gap between 2022 and 2023 is significant, and I think a big reason behind that is probably the fact that last year I spent a lot more time playing video games than I did music. 

An interesting note is that I rated things higher than my ongoing average - I scored 32.4% of the albums I listened to “great”, a decent increase on the 28.45%  average from all years combined. I’m not sure if that means that I’m just listening to stuff I know I’m going to like, if I’m getting soft in my older age and being nicer, or if I just listened to a lot of great stuff in 2023. I guess we’ll see if I’m as positive in 2024.

#### EPs/Mixtapes

![Graph showing EPs/Mixtapes count and rating breakdown](/public/images/2024-01/aoty/ep-mixtape-graph.png)

EPs/Mixtapes has been a category I never know if I want to continue with. I feel like there’s an important distinction to be made between Albums and EPs because they hold different expectations and running times. Same goes with Albums and Mixtapes, where the latter I kinda view as being okay if it’s less focused and more about being a collection of songs. But should EPs/Mixtapes be the one category? Probably not but also I’m 7 years deep and the idea of changing anything about my process significantly scares me, so here we are.

I don’t have too much insight to provide here. Somehow I listened to no bad EPs or mixtapes in 2023, which first happened in 2019 and I’m still surprised that that’s the case for either year. I also can’t believe that in 2020 and 2022 I listened to the same amount of EPs and mixtapes, such a weird coincidence. 

### New artists listened to

In 2016, I felt like I was in a musical rut of some kind. Whenever I would find a new artist, I would need to listen to their entire discography. Cool in theory but in practice I just wasn’t listening to a lot of new music or wouldn’t want to check out new artists if they had too much of a backlog. So to break that habit, I decided to try listening to 52 new artists I’d never heard albums from before in 52 Weeks. Since then I feel like I do nothing but listen to new artists so maybe I overcorrected too much lol. Anyway that’s all a prelude to the next chart: how many new artists I’ve listened to!

![Graph showing EPs/Mixtapes count and rating breakdown](/public/images/2024-01/aoty/new-artists-graph.png)

77 new artists, making up a total of 62.6% of the artists I listened to. This year I actually did a fair amount of relistening to things I’ve heard before so it’s nice that I still got some variety in there anyway. New artists did pretty good at the end of year rankings, which I suppose is to be expected from a majority - 2/6 of the albums I ranked as best from 2023 were new artists, and 100% of my EPs/Mixtapes as well as best albums not released in 2023 were new artists to me as well! 

Looking back at the historical numbers, there’s that stretch between 2019 and 2021 where I didn’t listen to 52 new artists but otherwise I’ve actually been pretty successful in achieving the 52 Artists/Weeks challenge - hell I did more than double than that in 2022 somehow. I’m feeling mildly confident about doing 52+ again this year but I dunno. Maybe this is the year I get into playlists instead. 


<hr>

Despite the fact that I love music and I love keeping track of everything, I feel like this was the hardest article to write. If I’m being honest, I don’t really feel like it’s particularly good. Feels like it’s lacking a good structure and through line, instead it’s just half reviews and half looking at some graphs. It was fun to compare numbers and stuff, but I think I’ll have to go back to the drawing board on what this post looks like if I write something for this year’s wrap up. At least I got to use the word “sophomore” properly like I’m a real reviewer man. 

Anyway, hey I think that’s the end of my 2023 wrap up posts. Thanks for reading them! This is all ultimately for me but much like a tree falling in the woods, I’m only making sounds if you’re reading these. I’m sure that’s the right way to use that metaphor. I have a couple future blog posts I’m cooking up in the background and maybe even an ongoing feature where I do monthly short form reviews of a game, a movie and an album in one article. Or maybe this is the last post I’ll ever make and I’ll have to do the awkward small talk with people where I go “yeah haha I’ve been meaning to get back to posting on that, just haven’t really had the time you know?” but we’ll both know that it’s not so much a time thing but more of a lack of passion thing. I really hope it’s the former but hey who knows right?
