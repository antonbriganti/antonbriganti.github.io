I came prepared with a joke. “I thought there’d be a couch!” It seemed like a pretty easy opener, and I wasn’t sure what this process was going to be like. I make jokes when I’m nervous. As we went to the room, I saw two chairs and thought it was going to be an easy slam dunk. 

I didn’t find the right timing for it, as he asked me how I found getting to the clinic. He has a calm, soothing voice, as you’d expect of someone in his profession. We exchanged some basic pleasantries, and then we started talking about why I’m here. I said I haven’t been feeling right for a while, and I realised I needed to finally do something about it. I start talking about how I’ve been feeling lately. I talk about how long it’s been going on, which I thought was only a couple months but it actually might be a couple years, and maybe even longer depending on how you classify whatever I’m feeling. I talk about what’s been on my mind and it’s not long before I’m tearing up after mentioning Nonno, as is usually the case. I apologise for the crying, and he tells me that it’s normal for people in a therapy session. I know he’s right, but I apologise again anyway. 

The rest is kind of a blur. I talk and talk about what I’m always worrying about, how I think about death maybe a bit too much, or how even when I know that I’ve locked the door to the apartment, I still need to go back to check it every now and then. I’m not sure I’m good at this whole therapy thing, but he’s not stopping me, so I guess I’m doing fine. It feels like an endless torrent coming out of me, and I watch as he writes down things on occasion or nods his head in response. Amongst my many words, I say the phrase “generalised anxiety”, and he agrees that’s the right term for it, asking if I’d looked up the diagnosis before I came. I tell him the truth - I looked up pretty much everything but a diagnosis.  I didn’t want to worry about that on top of everything else. 

We don’t do much more than him getting to know me, and me finding out how he works and stuff we’re likely to do. At one point he calls Nonno “grandpa”, an immediate reminder that this man is disconnected from the rest of my life. It brings me comfort. It was hard to admit I needed help, but it doesn’t feel so bad in the moment to receive it. I can almost ignore the strange feeling of guilt about having problems that I can’t fix myself. Almost. 

The session ends, we shake hands, and I go pay at reception. I’m self-conscious about my assuredly puffy eyes, but I mention that I have my next session already being booked. I get to the car and I drive home a bit too fast. I have to go back to work and play games with my team on Zoom without letting anyone know where I’ve been because I don’t want to tell them when I haven’t even told my parents I’m going to therapy yet, and I don’t know if I want my team knowing anyway. 

I try to put everything aside as I join the call, but one thing stays on my mind. I wish I’d said my joke.
